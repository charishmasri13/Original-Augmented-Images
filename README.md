# 🖼️ Image Augmentation Viewer

This project demonstrates image augmentation using Keras and displays the original image alongside its augmented version. It is useful for understanding how augmentation can be applied to training data in machine learning, especially in computer vision tasks.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The notebook performs the following:
- Loads an input image (e.g., `dog.jpg`)
- Applies transformations such as rotation, zoom, shear, and shift using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`
- Displays the original and augmented images side by side
